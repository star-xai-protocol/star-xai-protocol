# The STAR-XAI Protocol: Chronicles of Training a Transparent AI

![STAR-XAI Protocol Banner](https://github.com/star-xai-protocol/star-xai-protocol/blob/main/banner.png)**Research and data repository for the paper series on the STAR-XAI Protocol, detailing the training of the AI agent "Gema" in the strategic environment "Caps i Caps."**

---

## Project Abstract

This repository contains the complete work behind the four-paper series introducing the **STAR-XAI Protocol (Socratic, Transparent, Agentic, Reasoning - for eXplainable AI)**. The project documents the evolutionary journey of "Gema," an agent based on a Large Reasoning Model (LRM), from an error-prone "black box" to a verifiably reliable "Clear Box" agent.

Through Socratic dialogue and a set of rigorous integrity protocols, we demonstrate how to induce **Second-Order Agency**â€”an AI's ability to reason about its own reasoningâ€”achieving *ante-hoc* transparency and eliminating "state hallucinations" by design.

## The Paper Series

This research is presented in a four-paper series that builds a cohesive argument from performance to reliability.

* **ðŸ“„ [Paper 1: The STAR-XAI Protocol: An Interactive Framework for Inducing Second-Order Agency in AI Agents]**
    * Introduces the protocol's architecture, its components (CTP, Gameplay Cycle), and how Socratic dialogue fosters the emergence of advanced agency.

* **ðŸ“„ Paper 2: The Emergence of Strategic Reasoning: A "Clear Box" Analysis of Second-Order Agency within the STAR-XAI Protocol**
    * Analyzes how, from a simple set of rules, Gema develops complex tactics and sophisticated strategic reasoning, refuting the notion of an "illusion of thinking."

* **ðŸ“„ Paper 3: The Clear Box: Demonstrating Ante-Hoc Transparency and Interactive Explainability with the STAR-XAI Protocol**
    * Focuses on explainability, demonstrating how the protocol ensures *ante-hoc* transparency (justifying before acting) and how supervisor interaction generates an auditable reasoning log.

* **ðŸ“„ Paper 4: An Immune System for AI: Zero Hallucinations by Design Through Self-Correction and State Locking with the STAR-XAI Protocol**
    * Concludes the series by arguing that the protocol's architecture functions as an "immune system" that eliminates "state hallucinations," guaranteeing agent reliability through state-locking with Checksums.

## The Testbed Environment: "Caps i Caps"

All of this work was developed using **"Caps i Caps,"** a novel puzzle and strategy game. Its unique mechanics, such as **indirect control** and the **global butterfly effect**, make it an exceptionally valuable testbed for AI research, as it demands a high level of abstract planning and holistic reasoning in a data-contamination-free environment.
